Doubt

But are you withholding love?
Or are you just so spent yourself..
See here I am still giving you the benefit of the doubt
It’s the heart still trying to beat
On a trickle of blood
That trickle of love

An athlete’s heart gets more efficient
Doing more work as more work needs doing
Cycling and running the blood gets sent
And getting fitter means doing more with less 

A lover’s heart must do the same
It’s easy to push out love when much comes in
Harder when it’s a trickle

If getting fitter feels like dying
My heart must be getting so strong
