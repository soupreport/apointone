I. This is not a law review article. This is a rant.

This is a first person account of the weakening, sissifying, and coddling of American kids as a result of a litigation explosion that wants to make everything so freaking safe that nothing can ever happen. Remember Finding Nemo? When the dad doesn’t want anything to happen to Nemo, and Dory says how could you want NOTHING to happen? Well, consider this the plea  of at least one Dory who asks the litigious world of safety-this and safety-that, are you happy with the changes you have wrought? Because I think you’ve taken it much too far.

II. How Fear of Lawsuits Killed Childhood Fun

Thanks to your over-zealous representation of injured people, you have cowed the public – from individual property owners to municipalities – into a fear of litigation that results in attempts to minimize liability by removing anything that might be fun, especially fun for kids.
Diving boards? Dangerous. Tall Swings? Dangerous. Merry-go-rounds that actually spin so fast you can go flying off into the sand if you let go? Dangerous. A backyard zip-line that you actually have to hold on to, with your hands? Unspeakably dangerous.

III. The Baby-Proofing of Parks and Backyards

If you are a parent or a grandparent, and you’ve taken your little ones to the park lately, you can see that these places are not what they used to be. And parents wouldn’t dare have one of those zip-lines in the back yard – lest some visiting child break an arm and sue you. The worst thing about it, is that even if the parents of the kid with the broken arm are your friends, and they don’t want to sue you, their insurance company sure will. Take down the zip line. Take down the trampoline.

For the city parks, same thing. Can’t expose the city coffers to lawsuits from every little Jack and Jill with a bruise or a broken bone. Get rid of the merry-go-round, put in some super-safe contraption that doesn’t move, and while we’re at it, put in some rubberized floor and make everything padded. So nothing can happen.

IV. When Nothing Happens, Nothing Happens

And nothing does. And the parks are boring and uneventful, and the parents and grandparents who take their kids often comment to each other – remember those merry-go-rounds we used to have? They wouldn’t allow that today.

I remember going to the park next to my elementary school, where there were some super-tall swings. It was one of those bare metal frames, and the swings were just black rubber seats, suspended from long chains. I remember swinging so high I would try to reach the branches of the giant tree nearby. I remember swinging so high I thought the swing might go upside down and just go totally slack and dump me out. I remember that feeling in my belly of whoa that was high.

I remember sometimes getting the guts to jump off the swing just as it reached the optimal height, and flying through the air to land in the sand. That was so much fun! Yeah, but that can not happen today. Those swings are too dangerous. Some kid could go flying through the air and just land in the sand! Unthinkable. He would sue for some kind of injury. Can’t have that. No city can afford to defend all those suits. Take them out and put in some fool-proof equipment.

V. “That Would Never Happen Today”

So many times when I talk with anyone older than me, and get them to tell me a story about the most fun thing they ever did as a kid, as a teenager, in school, the answer I get will be a story of some kind of shenanigan, and as often as not, it ends with “that would never happen today”. Or I’ve seen my own teenagers react to stories of their grandfather’s adventures as a kid and say “that could never happen today.” 

This is not always a good thing.

VI. What Risk Used to Teach Us

We learn from adventure, we learn from exposure to the unknown, to the thrill in the belly of going flying swinging jumping hanging holding our own weight. Do you know that a lot kids today can’t even do a pull-up? These kids have more access to nutrition than any other group of humans ever in all of history, and they are so weak they can’t even hold their own weight? Too coddled, too babied.

When you went flying off the merry-go-round into the sand, you learned two things at least – one, you should hold on tighter, and two, you will be ok if you fall, so get back up there and try again. Oh, and three – that was fun!

VII. Safety as a Numbing Behavior

Brené Brown explains the concept of numbing behaviors – when people want to avoid uncomfortable feelings like anger or anxiety, they often resort to things like drinking or endless scrolling on their phones. These become numbing behaviors. But, she says, when you numb the uncomfortable feelings, you also numb the wonderful ones. Drink so much you can’t feel sadness? Sure, that’ll work. But keep it up and soon you won’t be able to feel joy either.

Premises liability is a numbing behavior too. When we make it so that everything is safe, so that there’s no chance of danger, or injury, of discomfort, we also make it so that everything is numb. There’s also no chance of thrill, adventure, of that feeling in your belly when you swing so high that you think you might go all the way around in a giant loop. That feeling is one of life’s greatest teachers, and we have shut it down – we’ve litigated it out of our parks and public places and our backyards.

VIII. What Happens When These Kids Grow Up

What would be the result of an entire generation of kids for whom thrill is foreign, who are weaker than their parents were, sheltered from so much risk of the little bumps and bruises of life?
What happens when they reach adulthood? What happens when life gives them real problems? When they don’t have the storehouse of experiences in their bones, experiences which have taught them – it’s ok, get up and try again, just hold on tighter this time?

IX. Small, Real Examples of How This Plays Out

A friend recently told me his school may have to shut down its sailing team.

I put up a swing in my front yard, on a tree on the swale. My kids had used it for a few years, but it was still in very good condition and when we moved to a new house I hung it up on a tree in front of the house. In the evening, I would sit on it and talk on the phone. During the day, I’d often see nannies stop and put toddlers on it. When our street hosted a neighborhood picnic, everyone enjoyed the swing.

But one day code enforcement drove by, and left me a warning. Can’t have a swing on a tree that’s on the swale. From my conversations with the good municipal servants responsible, I was able to gather that this is basically a liability job. What if someone falls off the swing and sues the city? And just like that, there goes the swing.

X. How We Ended Up Here

When did this begin? It seems there was a “litigation explosion” in the 1980s that is responsible for this super-safety-seeking insurance framework. Plaintiffs lawyers really got rolling, suing property owners for injuries incurred by visitors. Was it the reward-based punitive damage rules? Was it the large jury awards for damages based on pain and suffering? Why did plaintiffs begin to feel entitled to sue someone – the idea that, if I’ve been harmed, someone should pay?

I’m old enough to remember what it was like to go to a summer camp that was run by teenagers. And I’m old enough to remember the effects of going to a park that had been “renovated” and made “safe” and thinking of it as being baby-fied – and as a result, boring for regular kids who want to play and have fun.

I remember hearing phrases like “what if something happens” and it usually meant the end of something fun we used to do.

XI. A Different Way of Growing Up (And Why It Mattered)

Thankfully my parents did keep that zip-line over the pool. And my summers were spent at a summer camp that was “run by teenagers”. We grew up with a healthy distrust of anyone over 19 who wanted to show up and try to organize us, or worse, tell us what was too dangerous, limiting us with their "What if something happens?" scaredy-cat language.

Could we make it to the end of the remote 3-mile “nature trail” with older kids telling stories about who might be in the woods? Could we row across the bay? Could we beach the boats on an island? Could we flip kayaks over endlessly? Afternoons of king of the dock and chicken fights in the pool? (Do today’s kids even know what those are?) I was lucky.

XII. What I Want Now

What do I wish for now? I wish for a premises liability reform that would dial back a lot of this safety stuff. It should be possible for premises to put up fun features, attractions like diving boards and swings, without worrying about unaffordable insurance rates.

XIII. Proof That Adventure Still Exists

A few years ago I spent a week with family in California, on the outskirts of Yosemite National Park. We stayed at a place that is a ski-friendly condo in the winter, and hiking-friendly in the summer. Gorgeous views, lots of hikes nearby. And the treat?

The real treat and highlight of the place? It turned out it was in walking distance to a lake. One side of the lake had a cliff-like face, where you could jump down ten feet or so into the water. Which was a thrill in and of itself. But then, on the cliff, there was a tall tree with -don’t tell anyone– a rope swing!

Imagine, you grab this rope, and swing way out into the water and let go and splash into the cold water. It was high, it was intimidating, and people would watch others go a few times while getting up the guts to try it. I had to watch for a while before I got the courage to give it a go. It was thrilling!

XIV. Why It Felt So Good

It was adventurous and fun and it was a rush, and I'm glad that I was fit and strong enough to do it. The kids with our group mostly tried it too -some were too scared, but even then, they jumped off the cliff, which was also high and scary. It was the kind of thing that no one should be prevented from trying, even if it is scary. Falling into water is generally safe.

At dinner after the trip to the rope swing, everyone was like on a high, exhilarated from the adventure, the remaining chill from the cold water, the release of energy and good feeling. I wish our daily lives had more of that.

XV. Do We Really Want a Nation of Wimps?

When we remove the possibility of thrill, fun, risk, we are left with only certainty, dullness, predictability, and the price is we don’t sharpen our skills, we don’t get stronger, we don’t get more courage. We are creating a nation of wimps. Is that really what we want?

When our public spaces encourage more adventurous activity, courageous activity, people will want to partake in those activities. Don’t we want a nation of adventurers? A nation of strong, fit, gutsy, daring people? We can start small, start with loosening up premises liability, but by all means let’s start.
