    <tr>
    <th>Basically</th>
    <td>Challenging math class, difficult subject, maybe class is a required part of the curriculum, not a lot of students choosing calc as an elective.</td>
    <td>Well, it's the most important subject we know of, and we didn't choose to be here (at least not that we can remember).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Leader</th>
    <td>Math teacher or professor - the expert on the subject.</td>
    <td>You - in your life.</td>

    <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <td>Students - assigned to class, some chose their professor/section, most didn't.</td>
    <td>Family, coworkers, friends. The people you deal with. Some you chose and chose you, but not all.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>The point</th>
    <td>Knowledge, pass an exam. Goal is to teach the students the subject to a level of competency.</td>
    <td>Goal is to be happy, to get along, to live competently and work well together. Some work and some peace.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>Alternate Goal</th>
    <td>Goal is to identify the best mathematicians and weed out the slackers. Make it hard to get an A!</td>
    <td>Goal is to identify the people worth your time, the people who have your best interests in mind. And weed out the mean, bad, disagreeable and hurtful ones. Make people prove they deserve your attention and love.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>Measurement-Stark</th>
    <td>Tests can be pass/fail, all or nothing. Credit for right answer only, not for your work.</td>
    <td>Interactions can be all or nothing and your judgment of others black and white. He's a bad person because he wronged me. F that guy. He's a _____ (fill in the blank).</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>Measurement-Gray</th>
    <td>Tests can be graded with points for work done correctly. If 9 out of 10 steps done right, get some credit for that. Especially in complex multi step calculations.</td>
    <td>Interactons can be forgiving, more gray - credit for intentions as you understand them. He didn't mean to hurt me. Benefit of the doubt (like Brene Brown's husband says). Acknowledge what people did with kindness or love or at least not intending hurt. Jesus parables: take the beam out of your own eye; let he without sin cast the first stone; forgive them Lord they know not what they do</td>
