Why

It can’t be your fault
You are not withholding love
You can’t stop love from flowing like water rushing all around
You can’t stop the sun from shining
Or the rain from raining
Or love from flowing from heaven through me and anyone open to it
You can’t stop the blood from arriving at my atria door
Asking to be let in

Why do I feel less love flowing right now then
It can’t be your fault
It’s something with me
I’m not open
I’ve gotten weak
I’m receiving less
I’ve reduced capacity

By waiting and holding on to little drips and drops 
Instead of opening up to receive a flow
I’ve gotten stuck

What it will take to get the love flowing
The blood pumping
Is me to let go of these occasional drips and be open 
For more

Let me not be attached to these little drops
They are only a hint of what is available 
When I release them 
I can open the door to the waterfall

My mistake is believing you are the source of the love
When what you are is inspiration to open
And I love that
But the source is everywhere
And there must be other inspiration in the universe
It can’t be only you
