No one cares?

No one cares what you say or feel or think!
Just live your life

You will be forgotten
What if that's good news?
To not be remembered or kept together or preserved
To never occur again
To have been a once-off, a spark, a blip not to be studied or examined or dissected
Not even to be known about
Dust to dust to dust to dust

No outline about you
No quiz no test
No pictures no texts
If no one cares about the has-beens,
Even less the never-weres!
So there, you are free. You’re welcome.
