You are free
No one cares
No one cares what you do
No one cares what you say or feel or think
Just go live your life

You will be forgotten
What if that is the greatest freedom?
To not be remembered or kept together or preserved
To never occur again
To have been a once-off, a spark, an inimitable blip not to be studied or examined or dissected
Not even to be known about
Dust to dust to dust to dust

No Monday morning quarterbacking of your life
No highlight reel
No pictures no texts

So there, you are free. You’re welcome.
