Love languages

If love flows through us
To others
If love is not something we make but something from God that we interpret we reflect
We transmit like in a game of telephone
The message is the same but it sounds different depending on the messenger
And after a while it’s just a different message

When love flows through me and I direct that love to you, it looks like:

Making something for you
Some art
Some food
Showing you something I found
At the store
In the water
Sharing something I read
Or learned
Laughing
Attention
Checking in
Agreeing with you
Giving you the benefit of the doubt
Trying to find what’s right in what you say, even if I think you’re partly wrong
Missing you


When I don’t do those things,
The love has slowed to a trickle 
It’s not that I don’t love you
Its just that for some reason the love is flowing elsewhere

Or for some reason not being attracted to me so I can transmit it to you

What do I miss? 
That thing in you that makes more love flow through me, which I can then transmit to you. 
Where did it go?
 
I miss you means I miss the the me that gets to reflect the love that flows through me when you’re around.

But I don’t miss you.
