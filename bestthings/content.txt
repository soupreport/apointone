The best things in life are not things. 
But they are things that are given. 

Hugs, kind words, attention and love
none of them are things 
But when we give them they become
the gift of understanding
  
If the musician plays a song and no one hears it but him
If the song plays and no one dances… 
Who shares the music and the energy?
Gifts with no recipient, music unheard
Touch unfelt, Art unseen, Poetry unsaid— These are gifts ungiven
Still beautiful and they still exist 
Still
 
Hugs are for giving
Hugs are forgiving
Kind words are for giving
Kind words are forgiving
Smiles are for giving
Smiles are forgiving
Attention is for giving
Attention is forgiving
Love is for giving 
Love is forgiving
The best things in life are meant to be given.
That’s right, the best things in life are forgiving.
