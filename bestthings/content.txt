The best things in life are not things. 
But they are things that are given. 

Dancing alone is fine, dancing with someone is better
Laughing to yourself is okay, a shared laugh is much better
A hug you can’t give is a tragedy
Attention you don’t give is a waste

If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it,
It just sits and waits to be found
And rots and feeds the bears and fungi
But the spectacular fall, the crashing sound, and only the other trees are there to witness it, I think the trees count too — If a tree falls in the forest and no one you know is there to hear it, the trees do
And what if the tree was mad about it?
But what if the tree gives itself to the forest, to the bears and the fungi?
  
If the musician plays a song and no one hears it but him
If the song plays and no one dances… 
Who shares the music and the energy?
Gifts with no recipient, music unheard
Touch unfelt, Art unseen, Poetry unsaid— These are gifts ungiven
Still beautiful and they still exist 
Still
 
Hugs are for giving
Hugs are forgiving
Kind words are for giving
Kind words are forgiving
Smiles are for giving
Smiles are forgiving
Attention is for giving
Attention is forgiving
Love is for giving 
Love is forgiving
The best things in life are meant to be given.
That’s right, the best things in life are forgiving.
