Sometimes you may get a bug.

A bug? Like a glitch in the code? 
Or a sickness that makes you feel low,
Or a listening device in your home,
Or an itch that you won't leave alone?
Yes, like all of those but in your bones.
It'll be a hitch in your mode
of thinking that won't let go.
You'll be bugged and everyone will know. 

When you are bugged by something you can't forgive and won't forget,
the best things for it are things you must give, not things that you get. 
You give these things and they help work the bugs out of your system.
But if you try to keep them they won't work, these things are meant for giving.
 
Hugs are for giving
hugs are forgiving 
Kind thoughts are for giving
Kind thoughts are forgiving 
Attention is for giving
Attention is forgiving 
Love is for giving 
Love is forgiving
And the benefit of the doubt
And the bugs can get worked out.
The best things in life are made for giving.
That’s right, the best things in life are forgiving.
