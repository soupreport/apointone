I could never be a poet
No one reads poetry anyway
Unless it’s a school assignment
I mean, who is reading this?

And I could never be a writer
Everyone uses chatgpt now
No one reads stuff written by a human
I mean, who’s reading this?

And I could never be a comparative scholar
No one knows what that is
I mean, what even is that?
I’d have to make it up

There! That’s it!
I’ll make up comparative scholar as a career

Hi, my name is Marianne 
And I am a comparative scholar of life. 

And you must be a student, 
or the rare lover of poetry
And you must read human words.
So glad you're here. Let's go!
