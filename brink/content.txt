I am not dying.
I am leaving some things behind
“I” is dying.

I am on the brink of some kind of change. 
I can feel it, and I don’t know what it is yet, but I have the urge to tidy up scraps of writing that have been gathering, cluttering, filling up pages and notes and notebooks. 
It’s time to compile them into an collection because they will soon be memories. And then I can move on to something new or different. 
  
I don’t want to forget the things I’ve learned but I also need to forget a lot of details so I can be free to absorb new ones. 
And writing down, or organizing my writing, allows me to do that. 

What does it mean to say I am not dying, but “I” is dying.  
  “I” is the person I think I am or think I have to be to function in the world. 
      My preferences, habits, ideas. 
That person is dying. 
  I am learning and have new preferences, I am programming new habits, I am developing new ideas. 
  The old ones served when I needed them. A letting go is coming soon. A letting go of current ieas, ego. 
"I" is dying.
