Love flow

In the body that’s healthy
It’s blood that flows
In the person who’s happy
It’s love that flows

And blood isn’t held
It’s cycled and sent
And love can’t be held
It’s received and it’s spent

A heart starved for blood
Struggles
Nothing to pump
It sputters
Nothing to send out
It shudders
Then Shutters

What if it kept the little it got Just a little too long It couldn’t get more It’d get stuck

Just as a person starved for love Could get stuck Clinging to a trickle

The heart is meant for more
